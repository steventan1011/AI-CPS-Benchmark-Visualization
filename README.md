# AI-CPS-Benchmark-Visualization
This project is an attempt to visualize AI-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (AI-CPS) to improve transparency, accountability, and decision-making. The project provides an interactive dashboard, diagrams, and animations to visualize the behavior of AI-CPS systems.

## Frontend

The frontend of the project is developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. The frontend provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to explore the behavior of AI-CPS systems. It includes interactive dashboards, diagrams, and animations to visualize the system's behavior and identify potential issues. The frontend communicates with the backend to retrieve data and perform analysis.

## Backend

The backend of the project is developed using Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework. The backend is responsible for retrieving data from the AI-CPS system, processing the data, and storing it in a database. The backend also performs analysis on the data and provides the frontend with the results. The backend uses various AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and identify potential issues.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for the frontend and backend using npm and Maven, respectively.
3. Start the backend server using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Start the frontend server using the command `npm run dev`. (You may need run `npm install` first.)

## Conclusion

Overall, this project serves as a foundation for further research and development in the field of AI-CPS visualization. The project demonstrates the importance of visualizing these complex systems to improve their transparency, accountability, and decision-making. The frontend, developed using Vue.js, provides an easy-to-use interface, while the backend, developed using Spring Boot, performs data retrieval and analysis.
